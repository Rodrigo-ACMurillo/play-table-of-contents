# Acknowledgements

First, I considered the two types of blockchain as different currencies. 
The responses in the REST endpoints separate as **type1** and **type2** 

Second, for simplification to do everything in 3 hours time (excluding the pauses), there is no persistence layer.
The JSON files are hardcoded in the application. If you want to change the source, go to the class ```BlockReader#readType1``` and change the path
