# Introduction

[Web based table of contents generator](https://tableofcontents.herokuapp.com)

There are plenty of markdown table of contents generators on github, but the installation of the dependencies is a lot of overhead for an occasional activity. That's the idea of this web app. 

In addition, it is a nice tutorial on Scala :smile:
 
# Online Generation

<br>1 Go to https://tableofcontents.herokuapp.com

# Docker

## Build

At the root of the project, run the command line

```
$ ./build-docker-image.sh
```

## Run locally

See the last Docker image build
```
$ docker images
```


To run locally, use the cmd

```
$ docker run --name <REPOSITORY_NAME> -p 9000:9000 -d <REPOSITORY_NAME>
```
where `REPOSITORY_NAME` is the last Docker image built,  something like `play-table-of-contents-a80175d`

It will run on "http://localhost:9000"

To stop from running

```
$ docker stop <REPOSITORY_NAME>
```
